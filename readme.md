# :pushpin: Links WEB Page

Hello! Diego here,

This project is a simple  **Links WEB Page** and was carried out during Bruno Cupertino live on youtube in order to learn basic **HTML** and **CSS** functions. With this project I also learned how to create commits to **GIT** and how to edit and create a good **README**.

To see the project [click here](https://diegofischerdev.github.io/linkspage/).
